# Grodot
<h3>Toying with a mod to the Godot Game Engine logo.</h3>

<h4>Demo video available here:</h4>

<p>What started out as a mod of the logo for the Godot Game Engine,<br> 
starts to look like a possible take off point for a meme engine....</p>

<p>Named the derived avatar Grodot (.blend file included) and <br>
  built a sample Godot project around it, where the avatar's jaw clacks as you type.</p>
